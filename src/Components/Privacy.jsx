                    2. Information We Collect
                    By using our Service and by submitting personal information to us through your use of our Service then this Privacy Policy will apply. The personal information we collect from you generally may include:
                    <br/>
                    2.1 Network information regarding transactions
                    <br/>
                    2.2 Your first wallet address created through the KeySplit plugin becomes publicly known to us. We receive only the public address and the address is sent to our server. We do not receive information from subsequent wallet creations through the Service.
                    <br/>
                    2.3 We may receive network information from you as a result of your interaction with our Service.
                    <br/>
                    2.4 Our service requires the highest level of browser permissions that could potentially lead to procurement of more personal information. For information on how we use these permissions for a limited purpose, and why this is necessary, can be found in paragraph 3 below.
                    <br/>
                    2.5 Your interactions with the Site are documented via Google Analytics and that information is processed by Google.
                </p>

                    3. The Way KeySplit Uses Your Personal Information
                    <br/>
                    3.1 Infura uses network information for purposes of maintaining blockchain services and therefore the operational infrastructure required to use the service.
                    <br/>
                    3.2 We become aware of the first public key created by virtue of the system design. All subsequent key creations remain anonymous. The public key we do receive is stored using data security and encryption.
                    <br/>
                    3.3 As with nearly all interactions that take place on the World Wide Web, our servers may receive information by virtue of your interaction with them, including but not limited to IP Addresses.
                    <br/>
                    3.4 Our service requires full browser permissions that could potentially be used to access additional personal information. Such browser permissions are used for an extremely limited technical purpose for allowing the Service to properly interact with your browser. No additional information is obtained beyond what is necessary to provide the Service. No information received is shared with any third-party except those affiliated with KeySplit or as required for provision of the Service.
                    <br/>
                    3.5 KeySplit uses Google Analytics for purposes of monitoring webtraffic. Any identifying information collected via Google Analytics is controlled by Google.
                    <br/>
                    3.6 Public blockchains provide transparency into transactions and KeySplit is not responsible for preventing or managing information broadcasted on a blockchain.
